## Contributing Pull Requests

### Pick an issue

If you want to know more on isuue, add a comment, we'll discuss assign it to you.

Please don't request an issue then ghost me!

### Get the repo

### Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button at the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

### Clone the repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/this-is-you/ml4gw.git
```

where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.

### Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd TravelGo
```

Now create a branch using the `git switch` command:

```
git switch -c your-new-branch-name
```

### Make Changes

Now just open the repo directory in your code editor of choice and start writing code to solve your issue!

### Push your changes 

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add "filename with extention in which you have made changes"

```

using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Add relavent message to the change you made"
```


Using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin -u your-branch-name
```

### Step 4: Open a pull request

Once there, you should see a button that says there have been changes and a "Compare and pull request" button next to it. Click that button, and if you don't see it, you should see another message that says this fork is 1 commit ahead of the fork. Select the contribute button, and then "open pull request", then fill out the info.


- [ ] The **title** should be something descriptive about what your changes do. 
- [ ] The **description** should include a summary and if possible a link and screenshot
- [ ] Add `ML4GW` as a reviewer
- [ ] Add yourself as an assignee

select the "Create pull request button", and that's all for now!



### Final Step: Wait for the review and make any requested changes

I'll take a look at your PR and make any recommended changes, or let you know it's good to go! If I request changes, please try to get to them as soon as you can.

Once it's been approved, I'll go ahead and merge it!

Celebrate.
