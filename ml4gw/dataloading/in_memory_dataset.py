class InMemoryDataset:
    """Dataset for iterating through in-memory multi-channel timeseries

    Dataset for arrays of timeseries data which can be stored
    in-memory all at once. Iterates through the data by sampling
    fixed-length windows from all channels. The precise mechanism
    for this iteration is determined by combinations of the keyword
    arguments. See their descriptions for details.

    Args:
        X:
            Timeseries data to be iterated through. Should have
            shape `(num_channels, length * sample_rate)`. Windows
            will be sampled from the time (1st) dimension for all
            channels along the channel (0th) dimension.
        kernel_size:
            The length of the windows to sample from `X` in units
            of samples.
        y:
            Target timeseries to be iterated through. If specified,
            should be a single channel and have shape
            `(length * sample_rate,)`. If left as `None`, only windows
            sampled from `X` will be returned during iteration.
            Otherwise, windows sampled from both arrays will be
            returned. Note that if sampling is performed non-coincidentally,
            there's no sensible way to align windows sampled from this
            array with the windows sampled from `X`, so this combination
            of arguments is not permitted.
        batch_size:
            Maximum number of windows to return at each iteration. Will
            be the length of the 0th dimension of the returned array(s).
            If `batches_per_epoch` is specified, this will be the length
            of _every_ array returned during iteration. Otherwise, it's
            possible that the last array will be shorter due to the number
            of windows in the timeseries being a non-integer multiple of
            `batch_size`.
        stride:
            The resolution at which windows will be sampled from the
            specified timeseries, in units of samples. E.g. if
            `stride=2`, the first sample of each window can only be
            from an index of `X` which is a multiple of 2. Obviously,
            this reduces the number of windows which can be iterated
            through by a factor of `stride`.
        batches_per_epoch:
            Number of batches of window to produce during iteration
            before raising a `StopIteration`. Must be specified if
            performing non-coincident sampling. Otherwise, if left
            as `None`, windows will be sampled until the entire
            timeseries has been exhausted. Note that
            `batch_size * batches_per_epoch` must be be small
            enough to be able to be fulfilled by the number of
            windows in the timeseries, otherise a `ValueError`
            will be raised.
        coincident:
            Whether to sample windows from the channels of `X`
            using the same indices or independently. Can't be
            `True` if `batches_per_epoch` is `None` or `y` is
            _not_ `None`.
        shuffle:
            Whether to sample windows from timeseries randomly
            or in order along the time axis. If `coincident=False`
            and `shuffle=False`, channels will be iterated through
            with the index along the last channel moving fastest.
        device:
            Which device to host the timeseries arrays on
