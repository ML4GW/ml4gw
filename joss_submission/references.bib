abstract = {We report a gravitational-wave parameter estimation algorithm, AMPLFI, based on likelihood-free inference using normalizing flows. The focus of AMPLFI is to perform real-time parameter estimation for candidates detected by machine-learning based compact binary coalescence search, Aframe. We present details of our algorithm and optimizations done related to data-loading and pre-processing on accelerated hardware. We train our model using binary black-hole (BBH) simulations on real LIGO-Virgo detector noise. Our model has  million trainable parameters with training times  h. Based on online deployment on a mock data stream of LIGO-Virgo data, Aframe + AMPLFI is able to pick up BBH candidates and infer parameters for real-time alerts from data acquisition with a net latency of  s.}

title = {GWAK: gravitational-wave anomalous knowledge with recurrent autoencoders},
journal = {Machine Learning: Science and Technology},
abstract = {Matched-filtering detection techniques for gravitational-wave (GW) signals in ground-based interferometers rely on having well-modeled templates of the GW emission. Such techniques have been traditionally used in searches for compact binary coalescences (CBCs), and have been employed in all known GW detections so far. However, interesting science cases aside from compact mergers do not yet have accurate enough modeling to make matched filtering possible, including core-collapse supernovae and sources where stochasticity may be involved. Therefore the development of techniques to identify sources of these types is of significant interest. In this paper, we present a method of anomaly detection based on deep recurrent autoencoders to enhance the search region to unmodeled transients. We use a semi-supervised strategy that we name ‘Gravitational Wave Anomalous Knowledge’ (GWAK). While the semi-supervised approach to this problem entails a potential reduction in accuracy compared to fully supervised methods, it offers a generalizability advantage by enhancing the reach of experimental sensitivity beyond the constraints of pre-defined signal templates. We construct a low-dimensional embedded space using the GWAK method, capturing the physical signatures of distinct signals on each axis of the space. By introducing signal priors that capture some of the salient features of GW signals, we allow for the recovery of sensitivity even when an unmodeled anomaly is encountered. We show that regions of the GWAK space can identify CBCs, detector glitches and also a variety of unmodeled astrophysical sources.}

title = {Demonstration of machine learning-assisted low-latency noise regression in gravitational wave detectors},
journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
abstract = {Low-latency noise regression algorithms are crucial for maximizing the science outcomes of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA gravitational-wave detectors. This includes improvements in the detectability, source localization and pre-merger detectability of signals thereby enabling rapid multi-messenger follow-up. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepClean, a convolutional neural network architecture that uses witness sensors to estimate and subtract non-linear and non-stationary noise from gravitational-wave strain data. Our study uses LIGO data from the third observing run with injected compact binary signals. As a demonstration, we use DeepClean to subtract the noise at 60 Hz due to the power mains and their sidebands arising from non-linear coupling with other instrumental noise sources. Our parameter estimation study on the injected signals shows that DeepClean does not do any harm to the underlying astrophysical signals in the data while it can enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of potential signals. We show that DeepClean can be used for low-latency noise regression to produce cleaned output data at latencies ~1–2 s. We also discuss various considerations that may be made while training DeepClean for low latency applications.}
